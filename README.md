#Problems:
	1. Implementing the similarity function
	2. Calling the similarity function on the files
#Problem 1
	To implement the similarity function we write a function that takes two vectors as parameters.
	The function would then compute the similarity of the two vectors and return it as a double.
#Problem 2
	Calling the similarity function on the files given from the command line would give us our programs desired output
	We would call the similarity function on the test data and every training data that was passed to our program
	Whichever training data had the highest frequency would be the file name that we output
